<strong><h1 style="color: blue">                                 BIO </h1></strong>
<p>     I was born on June 15,2001 which makes me 15 years old. Even at a young age I was already on my way toward to pursuit of knowledge.
 You see I just loved playing with legos, and my my did I build some impressive creations for a six year old. By the time I was 8 however I had turned to computer games.
 More specificaly, I bought Minecraft. I was absolutley addicted, couldnt get off of it. I played far far to much but I enjoyed myself thouroughly. I created giant structures and shaped redstone in ways not many people understood
 It was around this point that I was absolutley sure, without a doubt I wanted to be an engineer. My desire for building took hold while I watched planes fly above my head at airshows and I decided that I was going to learn how to make one.
 I had always been a good student, certainly more dedicated than most and with this new desire I made leaps and bounds toward my goal. Along the way I found myself reading alot of books and I traveled the world with my family on summer vacations.
 I played more and more complex games, learned more about the complexity of the universe, read alot, and my dream grew to new heights. I am now part of the PLTW program here at Ayala highschool, I am a bookreader, a gamer, a dreamer, a knowledge seeker, and a dedicated student.
 As my father has advised me, I hope to politly wipe the floor with my fellow students, no offense intended.</p>
